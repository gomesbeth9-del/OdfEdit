 Name:        OdfEdit
 Purpose:     Application helping to edit in plain text an organ definition file (ODF)
              made for the GrandOrgue application (see github.com/GrandOrgue/grandorgue)
              and allowing to convert a Hauptwerk ODF into GrandOrgue ODF
              Implemented with Python 3.1x
              Tested in Windows and Ubuntu
              It is contains following classes :
                   C_LOGS to manage the logs generated by the various fonctions of the application
                   C_AUDIO_PLAYER to play audio files (wave or wavpack format)
                   C_ODF_MISC to manage miscellaneous feature of an ODF (compass extension for example)
                   C_ODF_DATA_CHECK to check the syntax and the consistency of the edited ODF data
                   C_ODF_DATA to manage the edited ODF data
                   C_ODF_HW2GO to do the conversion from a Hauptwerk ODF to a GrandOrgue ODF
                   C_GUI_NOTEBOOK to manage the notebook widget and its tabs content in the GUI of the application
                   C_GUI to manage the graphical user interface of the application
                   ToolTip to display a tool tip on a GUI widget
                   AskUserChooseListItems to manage a dialog window asking the user to choose items in a list
                   AskUserAnswerQuestion to manage a dialog window asking the user to answer to a question by pressing buttons
                   AskUserEnterString to manage a dialog window asking the user to enter a string

 The considered GrandOrgue ODF syntax is :
    [object_uid]  ; comment, section name (object_uid, object unique id) can contain only alphanumeric characters
    ; comment line, empty lines are ignored
    attribute1=value1  ; comment, attribute field can contain only alphanumeric or '_' characters
    attribute2=value2

 The new panel format is detected if the Panel000 section is present and contains the attribute NumberOfGUIElements

                          Pressing the Delete key of the keyboard does the same action as clicking on the Delete button

                          Improvement of the viewer's features :
                            - the viewer is inactive when its tab is not selected
                            - the images zoom/unzoom is centered on the mouse cursor position
                            - when a Panel section is selected, all images of its children sections are displayed (images off or first image by default)
                            - when a section having an image is selected, all images of the same panel are displayed with a reduced brightness
                            - when an image file is clicked in the text of a section, this image is displayed and others of the same panel are displayed with a reduced brightness
                              or are not displayed if they are other images of the same manual
                            - if OdfEdit is executed with the Windows executable or in a normal Python process (Windows or Linux), WavPack files can be played.
                              if OdfEdit is executed with the Linux executable, WavPack files cannot be played (this is to avoid to have the size of the OdfEdit executable file increased by 36MB)
                          (the version v10.1.0 at least of the library Pillow must be installed)
   v2.16 - 01 Dec 2024  - Menu button moved at the most left position
                          Button New renamed in Close and move at the right

                          Adding a button "File picker" permitting to set in the text editor the file of the attribute on which is placed the insertion cursor
                          Adding "undo" / "redo" buttons in the text editor
                          Grouping the buttons "Apply changes", "Undo", "Redo", "File picker" and "Help" in a new buttons bar at the top of the text editor
                          Adding a contextual menu in the logs area, displayed on mouse right click, permitting to clear logs or to select the section which the name is under the mouse cursor
                          Improvement of the ODF Reload processing to make it faster
                          Fixes and improvements in the ODF data check feature
                          Performance improvements in the ODF data processing
                          The search in the help can be done with regular expressions or with case unsensitive/sensitive. The index of the focused found occurrence is displayed.
                          Improvements of the images viewer's features :
                            - a right click on an image permits to select/unselect it and its section in the text editor and the list/tree
                            - a right click drag on an image permits to move it and update consequently its coordinates in the text editor
                            - the zoom-in has more effect than the zoom-out
                          HW2GO : files not found in the sample set folders are converted all the same in the GO ODF if they are not addressing Hauptwerk Standard Components packages
                                  (if their package ID is higher than 10)
   v2.17 - 23 Dec 2024  - Support of multiple sections selection. Drag & drop and Parent/Clone/Delete buttons can act on selected sections. More details in the help.
                          A section referenced in a PanelElement section is its child and no more its parent
   v2.18 - 23 Jan 2025  - Drag & drop with mouse and control key pressed permits to clone the selected sections before/after a hovered section of the same type
                          Improvements in the selection management in sections lists / tree
                          Fixed missing detections of some image definition attributes for the file picker button enabling
                          Fixed a regression in the images viewer not displaying manuals in v2.17
   v2.19 - 18 Apr 2025  - ODF data check : fix related to the NumberOfSwitches attribute of a Panel section
                          ODF data check : fix related to negative values set in CouplerNumber999 and StopNumber999 attributes of a General section
                          HW2GO : supporting the use case where the switch of a keyboard key has no defined image
